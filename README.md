# Deno Scripts

JavaScript/TypeScript is an awesome scripting language, certainly better than Bash, Zsh, etc.. Most everyone knows some JavaScript.

[Deno](https://deno.land/) is a an awesome TypeScript engine. Because it only requires a single binary to install, it's super easy to bootstrap on a new system.  It's fully cross platform and installations are localized to the user that installed them, so no global installation woes like with NodeJS.  And it's secure by default so you have some control over what scripts can do.
